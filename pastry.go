// Application is an interface that other packages can fulfill to hook into Pastry.
//
// OnError is called on errors that are even remotely recoverable, passing the error that was raised.
//
// OnDeliver is called when the current Node is determined to be the final destination of a Message. It passes the Message that was received.
//
// OnForward is called immediately before a Message is forwarded to the next Node in its route through the Cluster. The function receives a pointer to the Message, which can be modified before it is sent, and the ID of the next step in the Message's route. The function must return a boolean; true if the Message should continue its way through the Cluster, false if the Message should be prematurely terminated instead of forwarded.
//
// OnNewLeaves is called when the current Node's leafSet is updated. The function receives a dump of the leafSet.
//
// OnNodeJoin is called when the current Node learns of a new Node in the Cluster. It receives the Node that just joined.
//
// OnNodeExit is called when a Node is discovered to no longer be participating in the Cluster. It is passed the Node that just left the Cluster. Note that by the time this method is called, the Node is no longer reachable.
//
// OnHeartbeat is called when the current Node receives a heartbeat from another Node. Heartbeats are sent at a configurable interval, if no messages have been sent between the Nodes, and serve the purpose of a health check.
